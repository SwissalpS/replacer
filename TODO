-- inspection tool: add button to open unified_inventory's formspec
    this may no longer be as important and isn't that practical as there are
    now so many buttons. It would be hard to keep clear which item will be shown.
    <OgelGames@Discord> SwissalpS: by using player:set_inventory_formspec() unified_inventory
        binds itself to the 'i'-key
        https://github.com/minetest-mods/unified_inventory/blob/d6688872c84417d2f61d6f5e607aea39d78920aa/internal.lua#L302-L306
    <OgelGames@Discord> I think you could open it by sending the formspec from
        unified_inventory.get_formspec(player, page)
    maybe we can use this on group buttons
